## Wage Prediction Regression Model

This is a wage prediction model developed on the [Wage](https://rdrr.io/cran/ISLR/man/Wage.html) dataset of **ISLR** package. The dataset consists of wage data for 3000 male workers from 2003 to 2009.

-   80% of the data were used for training whereas 20% of the data were set aside for testing.
-   Prediction can be made in two ways:
    1.  Uploading a *.csv* file containg the test data.
    2.  Entering the input parameters on the left panel for a single test data.
